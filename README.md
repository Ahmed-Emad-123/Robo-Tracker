# Robo-Tracker
## Basic Overview:
This repository contains the code, instructions, and resources for building a robot that can track a ball using OpenCV, ROS, CVZone, and Arduino. 
The robot utilizes computer vision and image processing techniques to detect the ball's position and movement, and then controls its motors to follow the ball.
## Features:
+ **Ball tracking**: 
  - The robot accurately tracks the ball in real-time using color detection and image processing algorithms.
+ **Robot control**: 
  - The robot utilizes ROS and Arduino to control its motors based on the ball's position and movement.
+ **Open-source libraries**: 
  - The project utilizes OpenCV, ROS, CVZone, and Arduino, making it accessible and customizable.
+ **Test script**: 
  - Includes a test.py script for testing the color detection algorithm and identifying the optimal color range for tracking the ball.
## Getting Started:
+ **Install dependencies**:
  - Install OpenCV, ROS, CVZone, and the Arduino IDE.
+ **Download code**:
  - Download the code from this repository.
+ **Configure settings**:
  - Adjust the code to specify the color range for ball detection, motor control parameters, and ROS communication settings.
+  **Upload code**:
  - Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino board and the ROS code to the robot's computer.
+ **Run the application**:
  - Execute the test.py script to test the color detection algorithm and then run the main tracking application.

## Documentation:
+ **Code documentation**: 
  - Comments and explanations within the code to understand its functionality.
+ **Arduino code guide**:
  - Explanation of the Arduino code for motor control.
+ **Testing guide**: 
  - Instructions on using the test.py script for color detection testing.
